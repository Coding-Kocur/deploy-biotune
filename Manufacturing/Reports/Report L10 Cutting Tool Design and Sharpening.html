    <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>

    <p>Cutting tools are fundamental components in machining operations, and their geometry directly affects the
        efficiency, quality, and economics of the metal removal process. The design and maintenance of cutting tools
        require a thorough understanding of tool angles and their influence on cutting performance. This laboratory
        exercise focused on the geometry of turning tools and the methods used to sharpen various types of cutting
        tools.</p>

    <p>The geometry of a cutting tool is characterized by several important angles, each serving a specific purpose in
        the cutting process. The rake angle influences chip formation and cutting forces, with positive rake angles
        reducing cutting forces but weakening the cutting edge. The relief angle prevents rubbing between the tool flank
        and the newly machined surface, reducing friction and heat generation. The cutting edge angles determine the
        direction of chip flow and affect surface finish quality.</p>

    <p>Tool sharpening is an essential maintenance operation that restores the cutting edges to their optimal condition.
        Different types of cutting tools require specific sharpening techniques and equipment. This laboratory provided
        practical demonstrations of sharpening methods for twist drills, shell end mill cutters, form relieved mill
        cutters, and hob cutters, each presenting unique challenges due to their complex geometries.</p>

    <h1>EXPERIMENTAL</h1>

    <h2>Task 1: Turning Tool Angle Measurement</h2>

    <p>The objective of this task was to measure the angles of a single-point turning tool using a protractor and angle
        measuring instruments. The measured values were recorded and used to compose the tool signature according to ISO
        designation standards.</p>

    </table>

    <p>The measured angles indicate that this turning tool has a relatively small back rake angle of 1.5°, which
        provides a stronger cutting edge suitable for harder materials or interrupted cuts. The side rake angle of 14°
        is moderate, providing a good balance between cutting efficiency and edge strength. The relief angles of 5° each
        are sufficient to prevent rubbing while maintaining adequate support for the cutting edge. The cutting edge
        angles of 17° and 20° determine the approach direction and chip flow characteristics.</p>

    <p>Based on the ISO designation system, the tool signature can be expressed as: 1.5 - 14 - 5 - 5 - 17 - 20 - 0.4 (λs
        - γ0 - α'0 - α0 - κ'r - ψ - rε).</p>

    <h2>Calculated Tool Geometry Parameters</h2>

    <p>Using the measured angles, additional geometric parameters of the cutting tool can be calculated:</p>

    <p>The wedge angle (β) represents the angle of the cutting wedge and is calculated as:</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">β = 90° - γ<sub>0</sub> - α<sub>0</sub> = 90° - 14° - 5° = 71°</p>

    <p>The cutting angle (δ) is the angle between the rake face and the cutting direction:</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">δ = 90° - γ<sub>0</sub> = 90° - 14° = 76°</p>

    <p>The tool included angle (ε) between the main and auxiliary cutting edges:</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">ε = 180° - κ<sub>r</sub> - κ'<sub>r</sub> = 180° - 20° - 17° = 143°</p>

    <p>Where κ<sub>r</sub> = 90° - ψ = 90° - 20° = 70° is the main cutting edge angle.</p>

        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>The relationship α + β + γ = 90° is verified: 5° + 71° + 14° = 90°, confirming the measurements are consistent.</p>

    <p>The wedge angle of 71° indicates a relatively strong cutting edge suitable for machining harder materials. A smaller wedge angle would provide a sharper edge but with reduced strength. The cutting angle of 76° is within the typical range for turning operations on steel and other common engineering materials.</p>

    <h2>Task 2: Sharpening of a Twist Drill</h2>

    <p>The demonstration covered the sharpening of a twist drill, which is one of the most commonly used cutting tools
        in manufacturing. Twist drills require periodic sharpening to maintain their cutting efficiency and produce
        accurate holes.</p>

    <p>The key aspects of twist drill sharpening include maintaining the correct point angle, which is typically 118°
        for general-purpose drilling but may vary for specific materials. The lip relief angle should be maintained at
        approximately 8-12° to provide clearance behind the cutting lips. Both cutting lips must be ground to equal
        length to ensure the drill cuts on center and produces round holes. For larger drills, web thinning may be
        necessary to reduce thrust forces. The sharpening was performed on a bench grinder with appropriate wheel
        selection and coolant application to prevent overheating of the cutting edges.</p>

    <h2>Task 3: Sharpening of Shell End Mill Cutter</h2>

    <p>Shell end mill cutters are multi-flute cutting tools used for face milling and peripheral milling operations. The
        demonstration focused on sharpening the relief angles on the cutting teeth.</p>

    <p>The primary relief angle, typically 4-8°, provides the first clearance behind the cutting edge, while the
        secondary relief angle of 12-15° provides additional clearance to prevent heel contact. Maintaining uniform
        tooth spacing during grinding ensures equal cutting load distribution among all teeth. Specialized tool and
        cutter grinders with indexing fixtures were used to ensure accurate and consistent relief angle grinding on each
        tooth, producing a keen cutting edge at the intersection of the rake face and relief surface.</p>

    <h2>Task 4: Sharpening of Form Relieved Mill Cutter</h2>

    <p>Form relieved cutters are specialized tools that produce complex profiles, such as gear teeth or thread forms.
        These cutters have a distinctive geometry where the relief is built into the tooth profile rather than ground as
        a flat surface.</p>

    <p>The critical consideration when sharpening form relieved cutters is that grinding must be performed exclusively
        on the rake face to preserve the form-relieved profile. Grinding must be performed parallel to the cutter axis
        to prevent distortion of the tooth profile, and the same amount of material must be removed from each tooth to
        maintain concentricity. The relief surface must never be ground, as this would destroy the precisely
        manufactured form that defines the profile being produced.</p>

    <h2>Task 5: Sharpening of Hob Cutter</h2>

    <p>Hob cutters are specialized gear cutting tools that generate gear teeth through a continuous rolling action. Hob
        sharpening is a critical operation requiring high precision.</p>

    <p>Like form relieved cutters, hobs are sharpened only on the rake face. Care must be taken to maintain consistent
        flute depth across all teeth, and the generating profile must be preserved exactly to produce accurate gear
        teeth. A fine surface finish on the sharpened face is essential for quality gear production. Specialized hob
        sharpening machines with precise indexing mechanisms and diamond or CBN grinding wheels were demonstrated during
        the laboratory.</p>

    <h1>CONCLUSIONS</h1>

    <p>This laboratory exercise on cutting tool design and sharpening provided valuable practical insights into the
        geometry and maintenance of cutting tools used in manufacturing operations.</p>

    <p>The measurement of turning tool angles demonstrated the importance of each geometric parameter in defining tool
        performance. The measured tool exhibited a back rake angle of 1.5°, side rake angle of 14°, relief angles of 5°,
        end cutting edge angle of 17°, side cutting edge angle of 20°, and nose radius of 0.4 mm. These angles combine
        to create a tool suitable for general-purpose turning operations, with the tool signature 1.5-14-5-5-17-20-0.4
        providing a standardized description of the geometry.</p>

    <p>The practical demonstrations of sharpening methods for various cutting tools highlighted the diversity of
        techniques required for different tool types. Twist drill sharpening emphasizes the importance of symmetric lip
        grinding and proper point angle maintenance. Shell end mill cutters require careful relief angle grinding while
        maintaining tooth-to-tooth consistency. Form relieved cutters and hob cutters present unique challenges as they
        can only be sharpened on the rake face to preserve their precision-manufactured profiles. These concepts are
        essential for effective tool management in manufacturing environments.</p>
