    <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>

    <p>Welding is a fabrication process that joins materials, usually metals or thermoplastics, by causing fusion. This
        is achieved by heating the workpieces to their melting point, with or without the addition of a filler material.
        Various welding methods exist, each with distinct characteristics, advantages, and applications. This laboratory
        focused on three primary arc welding methods: Shielded Metal Arc Welding (SMAW/SW), Tungsten Inert Gas (TIG)
        welding, and Metal Inert Gas (MIG) welding.</p>

    <p>Understanding the differences between welding methods is essential for selecting the appropriate technique for
        specific applications. Factors such as material type, thickness, required weld quality, production volume, and
        cost considerations all influence the choice of welding method. Additionally, the heat affected zone (HAZ)
        created during welding has significant implications for the mechanical properties of the welded joint.</p>

    <h1>EXPERIMENTAL</h1>

    <h2>Task 1: Comparison of Welding Methods (SW, TIG, MIG)</h2>

    <p>Shielded Metal Arc Welding (SMAW), also known as stick welding (SW), is one of the oldest and most versatile
        welding processes. In this method, an electric arc is struck between a consumable electrode coated with flux and
        the workpiece. The flux coating decomposes during welding, producing a shielding gas and slag that protect the
        weld pool from atmospheric contamination. SMAW is widely used due to its simplicity, portability, and ability to
        weld in various positions. However, it has relatively low deposition rates and requires frequent electrode
        changes.</p>

    <p>Tungsten Inert Gas (TIG) welding, also known as Gas Tungsten Arc Welding (GTAW), uses a non-consumable tungsten
        electrode to produce the arc. A separate filler rod may be added manually if needed. An inert shielding gas,
        typically argon or helium, protects the weld area from oxidation. TIG welding produces high-quality, clean welds
        with excellent control over the welding process. It is particularly suitable for thin materials and applications
        requiring precision, such as aerospace and food industry equipment. However, TIG welding is slower and requires
        more skill than other methods.</p>

    <p>Metal Inert Gas (MIG) welding, also known as Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW), uses a continuously fed consumable
        wire electrode and an inert shielding gas. The wire serves as both the electrode and the filler material,
        allowing for high deposition rates and continuous welding without electrode changes. MIG welding is faster than
        TIG and easier to learn, making it popular for production environments. It is suitable for a wide range of
        material thicknesses and provides good weld quality with proper settings.</p>

    <h2>Task 2: TIG Welding Process and Common Problems</h2>

    <p>The TIG welding process involves establishing an arc between the tungsten electrode and the workpiece while
        simultaneously feeding filler material (if required) and maintaining adequate shielding gas coverage. The welder
        controls the arc length, travel speed, and filler addition using both hands, requiring significant coordination
        and skill.</p>

    <p>Several common problems can occur during TIG welding. Tungsten contamination happens when the electrode contacts
        the weld pool, leaving tungsten inclusions in the weld. This can be avoided by maintaining proper arc length and
        using appropriate starting techniques. Porosity in the weld can result from inadequate shielding gas coverage,
        contaminated base metal, or moisture in the shielding gas. Proper cleaning of the workpiece and ensuring
        sufficient gas flow can prevent this issue.</p>

    <p>Oxidation of the weld pool is another significant problem, particularly when welding reactive metals like
        aluminum or titanium. This appears as discoloration around the weld and indicates insufficient shielding.
        Increasing gas flow rate or using a gas lens can improve coverage. Cracking can occur due to excessive heat
        input, improper filler material selection, or inadequate joint preparation. Controlling heat input through
        proper technique and selecting appropriate filler materials helps prevent cracking.</p>

    <h2>Task 3: Economic Analysis - TIG vs SW Methods</h2>

    <p>When comparing the economics of TIG and SMAW (stick) welding, several factors must be considered including
        equipment costs, consumable costs, labor costs, and productivity.</p>

    <p>Equipment costs for TIG welding are generally higher than for SMAW. A TIG welding system requires a power source,
        TIG torch, tungsten electrodes, shielding gas supply (cylinder and regulator), and often a foot pedal for
        current control. SMAW equipment is simpler, requiring only a power source, electrode holder, and electrodes. The
        initial investment for TIG is typically 2-3 times higher than for basic SMAW equipment.</p>

    <p>Consumable costs also differ between the methods. TIG welding requires shielding gas (argon is commonly used),
        tungsten electrodes (which last for multiple welds), and filler rods. SMAW requires only coated electrodes, but
        a significant portion (about 20-30%) of each electrode is discarded as stub ends. Over time, the consumable
        costs for both methods can be comparable depending on the application and gas prices.</p>

    <p>Labor costs and productivity represent the most significant difference. SMAW is faster for many applications,
        particularly on thicker materials and in field conditions. TIG welding, while producing superior weld quality,
        operates at slower travel speeds and requires more skilled operators who command higher wages. For applications
        where weld quality is paramount, the higher cost of TIG welding may be justified by reduced rework and better
        joint performance.</p>

    <h2>Heat Affected Zone (HAZ) Comparison</h2>

    <p>The heat affected zone is the region of base metal that has not melted but has experienced microstructural
        changes due to the heat of welding. The size and characteristics of the HAZ depend on the heat input, which is
        influenced by welding current, voltage, and travel speed.</p>

    <p>TIG welding generally produces a smaller HAZ compared to other methods due to its concentrated arc and precise
        heat control. The ability to adjust current with a foot pedal allows the welder to minimize heat input. SMAW
        typically produces a larger HAZ due to higher overall heat input. MIG welding falls between these two, with HAZ
        size dependent on travel speed and heat input settings.</p>

    <p>A smaller HAZ is generally desirable as it preserves more of the original material properties. Large HAZ zones
        can lead to reduced hardness, grain growth, and potential weakness in the welded joint. For applications
        requiring minimal property changes in the base metal, TIG welding offers advantages despite its slower speed.

    </div>
    <p class="figure-caption">Figure 2. Comparison of heat affected zones: TIG weld (top) showing narrow HAZ, MIG welds
        (bottom).</p>

    <h2>Automation of Welding Methods</h2>

    <p>The potential for automation varies significantly among welding methods. MIG welding is the most easily automated
        due to its continuous wire feed and stable process characteristics. Robotic MIG welding systems are widely used
        in automotive manufacturing and other high-volume production environments. The process is tolerant of minor
        variations and can maintain consistent quality over extended periods.</p>

    <p>TIG welding can also be automated, particularly for circumferential welds on pipes and tubes. Orbital TIG welding
        systems are common in pharmaceutical, semiconductor, and nuclear industries where high-purity welds are
        required. However, automated TIG systems are more complex and expensive than MIG automation.</p>

    <p>SMAW is the most difficult to automate due to its discontinuous nature (electrodes must be changed frequently)
        and the skill required to maintain arc stability. While some semi-automatic SMAW systems exist, full automation
        is rare and typically limited to specialized applications.</p>

    <h2>Protection of Liquid Pool from Oxidation</h2>

    <p>Protecting the molten weld pool from atmospheric contamination is essential for producing quality welds. Several
        methods are employed depending on the welding process. Inert shielding gases such as argon and helium displace
        atmospheric oxygen and nitrogen from the weld zone in TIG and MIG welding. Flux coatings on SMAW electrodes
        decompose to produce protective gases and form a slag layer that covers the weld pool. Vacuum welding eliminates
        atmospheric gases entirely but is limited to specialized applications. Back purging with inert gas protects the
        root side of the weld, particularly important for pipe welding and reactive metals.</p>

    <h1>CONCLUSIONS</h1>

    <p>This laboratory on welding technologies provided practical experience with different welding methods and
        understanding of their characteristics and applications.</p>

    <p>The comparison of SMAW, TIG, and MIG welding revealed distinct advantages and limitations for each method. SMAW
        offers simplicity and portability but lower productivity. TIG welding produces the highest quality welds but
        requires more skill and time. MIG welding provides a good balance of quality and productivity, making it
        suitable for production environments.</p>

    <p>The economic analysis showed that while TIG welding has higher initial costs and lower productivity, it may be
        cost-effective for applications requiring superior weld quality. The size of the heat affected zone is an
        important consideration, with TIG welding offering the smallest HAZ due to its concentrated heat input. For
        automation, MIG welding offers the best potential, followed by TIG for specific applications, while SMAW is
        largely limited to manual operation.</p>
