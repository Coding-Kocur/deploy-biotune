    <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>

    <p>Plastic deformation processes are fundamental manufacturing methods used to shape metals and alloys by applying
        forces that exceed the material's yield strength. These processes include operations such as deep drawing,
        punching, blanking, and formability testing. Understanding the relationships between process parameters and
        resulting forces is essential for optimizing manufacturing operations and ensuring product quality.</p>

    <p>Deep drawing is a sheet metal forming process in which a flat blank is transformed into a hollow, cup-shaped
        part. The process involves a punch that forces the sheet metal into a die cavity while a blank holder controls
        material flow. The blank holder plays a critical role in preventing wrinkling of the flange area while allowing
        sufficient material to flow into the die cavity.</p>

    <p>The Erichsen cupping test is a standardized method for evaluating the stretch formability of sheet metal. In this
        test, a spherical punch is forced into a clamped sheet until a crack appears. The depth of indentation at which
        fracture occurs, known as the Erichsen Index (IE), provides a measure of the material's formability during
        stretch forming operations.</p>

    <h1>EXPERIMENTAL</h1>

    <h2>Task 3: Deep Drawing Process Analysis</h2>

    <p>The objective of this task was to analyze the influence of the blank holder on the measured parameters and
        quality of drawn cups. Deep drawing experiments were conducted using sheet metal samples of varying thicknesses,
        with and without the application of a blank holder. The results are presented in Table 1.</p>

    <h2>Task 4: Influence of Blank Holder on Drawing Parameters</h2>

    <p>Analysis of the experimental results reveals the significant influence of the blank holder on the deep drawing
        process. For the thinnest material (0.5 mm thickness), the drawing force decreased from 14.5 kN without blank
        holder to 11 kN with blank holder. This reduction indicates that the blank holder helps control material flow
        and reduces friction-related forces during the drawing operation.</p>

    <p>For the 1 mm thick material, the drawing force was 29.5 kN without blank holder and 26 kN with blank holder,
        showing a similar trend of force reduction when the blank holder is applied. The blank holder prevents wrinkling
        of the flange, which would otherwise increase resistance to material flow and result in higher drawing forces.
    </p>

    <p>The quality of drawn cups is significantly affected by the presence of a blank holder. Without a blank holder,
        thin sheets are prone to wrinkling in the flange area as the unsupported material buckles under compressive
        stresses. The blank holder applies a controlled pressure that prevents this buckling while still allowing the
        material to flow into the die cavity. However, excessive blank holder force can cause tearing of the sheet, so
        proper adjustment is critical for achieving defect-free cups.</p>

    <h2>Task 5: Erichsen Test</h2>

    <p>The Erichsen cupping test was performed to evaluate the stretch formability of sheet metal samples. In this test,
        a sheet specimen is clamped between a blank holder and die, and a hemispherical punch with a diameter of 20 mm
        is forced into the sheet until a visible crack appears on the dome surface. The indentation depth at fracture is
        recorded as the Erichsen Index (IE), which indicates the material's ability to undergo biaxial stretching
        without failure.</p>

        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>The Erichsen test results show varying formability among the tested samples. Samples 1 and 2, with thicknesses of
        1.4 mm and 1.3 mm respectively, exhibited similar Erichsen indices of 14.15 mm and 14.4 mm. Sample 3, despite
        having the same thickness as Sample 1 (1.4 mm), showed a significantly higher Erichsen index of 18.75 mm,
        indicating superior stretch formability.</p>

    <p>The average Erichsen Index from the three tests is approximately 15.77 mm. Based on typical IE values for common
        materials, the tested sheets appear to be made of steel or aluminum alloy. The variation in IE values between
        samples of similar thickness suggests differences in material properties, surface conditions, or grain structure
        that affect formability. Materials with higher IE values are more suitable for deep drawing and stretch forming
        operations where significant plastic deformation is required.</p>

    <h1>CONCLUSIONS</h1>

    <p>This laboratory exercise on plastic deformation technologies provided practical understanding of deep drawing and
        formability testing processes.</p>

    <p>The deep drawing experiments demonstrated the importance of the blank holder in controlling material flow and
        preventing defects. The use of a blank holder generally reduced drawing forces for thin materials by preventing
        wrinkling and providing controlled resistance to material flow. The relationship between sheet thickness, die
        diameter, and drawing force was observed, with thicker materials requiring higher forces due to increased
        resistance to plastic deformation.</p>

    <p>The Erichsen cupping test provided a quantitative measure of sheet metal formability. The average Erichsen Index
        of approximately 15.77 mm indicates moderate to good stretch formability of the tested material. The variation
        in IE values among samples highlights the importance of material consistency in manufacturing operations
        requiring predictable forming behavior.</p>
