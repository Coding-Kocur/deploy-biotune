    <!-- INTRODUCTION -->
    <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>

    <p>The chip formation process is one of the most fundamental phenomena in metal cutting and machining operations.
        Understanding the mechanics of chip formation is essential for optimizing machining parameters, improving
        surface finish quality, extending tool life, and achieving economical material removal rates. This laboratory
        exercise focuses on the orthogonal cutting model, which provides a simplified two-dimensional representation of
        the complex three-dimensional cutting process that occurs during turning, milling, and other machining
        operations.</p>

    <p>During the cutting process, the workpiece material undergoes severe plastic deformation in a narrow zone called
        the shear plane or primary deformation zone. The material ahead of the cutting tool is sheared along this plane
        and flows over the rake face of the tool as a chip. The geometry of this deformation process, characterized by
        the shear angle Φ, determines the efficiency of the cutting operation and significantly influences cutting
        forces, power consumption, and heat generation.</p>

    <p>The chip ratio, defined as the ratio of chip thickness to uncut chip thickness (or equivalently, the ratio of
        uncut chip length to chip length), is a critical parameter that provides insight into the degree of plastic
        deformation occurring during cutting. A chip ratio greater than unity indicates chip thickening, which is the
        normal condition in metal cutting due to the shearing process. The chip ratio is influenced by several factors
        including cutting velocity, depth of cut, tool geometry (particularly the rake angle), and the mechanical
        properties of the workpiece material.</p>

    <p>The objectives of this laboratory exercise were to experimentally investigate the influence of cutting velocity,
        depth of cut, rake angle, and workpiece material on chip ratios and chip types. By systematically varying these
        parameters while holding others constant, the fundamental relationships governing chip formation were explored
        and quantified.</p>

    <p>The experimental results demonstrate that cutting velocity has a moderate influence on chip ratios within the
        tested range. As the cutting velocity increased from 11 mm/min to 44 mm/min, the chip ratio based on length
        measurements decreased slightly from 1.8 to 1.636, while the chip ratio based on thickness measurements
        decreased from 1.643 to 1.467. This indicates that at higher cutting velocities, there is somewhat less chip
        compression occurring during the cutting process.</p>

    <p>The shear angle values remained relatively stable across the range of cutting velocities tested, varying between
        34° and 38°. This stability suggests that while cutting velocity does influence chip formation, its effect on
        the fundamental geometry of the shear zone is less pronounced compared to other parameters such as rake angle.
    </p>

    <p>The relationship between cutting velocity and chip ratio can be explained by considering the strain rate effects
        in metal cutting. At higher cutting velocities, the material experiences higher strain rates in the shear zone,
        which can lead to strain rate hardening effects. Additionally, higher cutting velocities generate more heat at
        the tool-chip interface, which can reduce the flow stress of the material and facilitate easier chip flow over
        the rake face.</p>

    <p>The experimental data reveals a clear trend regarding the influence of depth of cut on chip ratios. As the depth
        of cut increased from 0.4 mm to 1.2 mm, the chip ratio based on length measurements increased progressively from
        1.636 to 2.0. This indicates that larger depths of cut result in greater chip compression, meaning the chip
        becomes relatively shorter compared to the uncut chip length.</p>

    <p>The chip ratio based on thickness measurements showed a similar but less pronounced trend, increasing from 1.375
        at 0.4 mm depth to 1.563 at 0.8 mm depth, then slightly decreasing to 1.522 at 1.2 mm depth. The shear angle
        remained relatively constant at approximately 35-36° across all depths of cut tested, with only a slight
        decrease to 34° at the maximum depth.</p>

    <p>The increase in chip ratio with increasing depth of cut can be attributed to several factors. Greater depths of
        cut result in larger chip cross-sectional areas, which require more energy for plastic deformation. The
        increased volume of material being deformed per unit time leads to higher temperatures in the cutting zone,
        which can affect the flow properties of the material and the friction conditions at the tool-chip interface.
        Additionally, larger chips experience greater constraint as they flow over the rake face, leading to increased
        compression.</p>

    <p>The experimental results demonstrate a significant relationship between rake angle and chip formation
        characteristics. As the rake angle decreased from 45° to 25°, the chip ratio based on length measurements
        increased from 1.8 to 2.0. This indicates that smaller (less positive) rake angles result in greater chip
        compression and more severe plastic deformation of the workpiece material.</p>

    <p>The shear angle showed a clear decreasing trend with decreasing rake angle, dropping from 35° at α = 45° to 31°
        at α = 25°. This relationship is consistent with metal cutting theory, which predicts that lower rake angles
        lead to lower shear angles because the material must undergo greater deformation to flow over the rake face.</p>

    <p>The influence of rake angle on chip formation can be understood by considering the mechanics of the cutting
        process. A larger positive rake angle creates a sharper cutting edge and reduces the resistance to chip flow
        over the rake face. This results in less chip compression and a more efficient cutting process with lower
        cutting forces. Conversely, a smaller rake angle increases the constraint on chip flow, leading to greater
        plastic deformation, higher chip ratios, and increased cutting forces.</p>

    <p>The practical implications of these findings are significant for tool design and process optimization. While
        larger rake angles reduce cutting forces and chip compression, they also weaken the cutting edge and may reduce
        tool life, particularly when machining harder materials. Therefore, the selection of rake angle requires
        balancing the benefits of easier chip formation against the requirements for tool strength and durability.</p>

    <p>The experimental observations revealed distinct chip types for each of the three workpiece materials tested under
        identical cutting conditions. Aluminum produced continuous chips, brass produced segmented chips, and cast iron
        produced discontinuous chips.</p>

    <p>The formation of continuous chips in aluminum is characteristic of ductile materials with high thermal
        conductivity. Aluminum is a face-centered cubic (FCC) metal with excellent ductility, allowing plastic
        deformation to occur without fracture. The material flows smoothly over the rake face, forming a long,
        ribbon-like chip that remains intact. Continuous chips are generally associated with good surface finish quality
        but may require chip breakers to prevent entanglement with the workpiece or machine components.</p>

    <p>Brass, being a copper-zinc alloy, exhibited segmented chip formation. Segmented chips, also known as serrated or
        saw-tooth chips, form when the material undergoes periodic catastrophic shear failure along the shear plane.
        This behavior is typical of materials with limited ductility or those that exhibit thermal softening effects.
        The chip appears as a series of connected segments with varying thickness along its length. The periodic nature
        of segmented chip formation can cause fluctuating cutting forces and may affect surface finish quality.</p>

    <p>Cast iron produced discontinuous chips, which is the expected behavior for this material. Cast iron is a brittle
        material due to the presence of graphite flakes in its microstructure. These graphite inclusions act as stress
        concentrators, causing the chip to fracture into small fragments almost immediately upon formation. While
        discontinuous chips are easier to handle and dispose of compared to continuous chips, the intermittent nature of
        chip formation results in fluctuating cutting forces and may cause surface finish deterioration.</p>

    <!-- CONCLUSIONS -->
    <h3>CONCLUSIONS</h3>

    <p>This laboratory exercise on chip formation processes provided valuable insights into the fundamental mechanisms
        governing material removal in metal cutting operations. Through systematic experimentation using the orthogonal
        cutting model, the influences of cutting velocity, depth of cut, rake angle, and workpiece material on chip
        ratios and chip types were quantitatively and qualitatively assessed.</p>

    <p>The investigation of cutting velocity effects demonstrated that increasing the cutting speed from 11 mm/min to
        100 mm/min resulted in a moderate decrease in chip ratio values. The chip ratio based on length measurements
        decreased from 1.8 to approximately 1.636, indicating that higher cutting velocities promote somewhat easier
        chip flow with less compression. However, the shear angle remained relatively stable between 34° and 38°,
        suggesting that cutting velocity has a limited effect on the fundamental geometry of the deformation zone within
        the tested range.</p>

    <p>The depth of cut experiments revealed a more pronounced relationship between this parameter and chip formation
        characteristics. Increasing the depth of cut from 0.4 mm to 1.2 mm caused the chip ratio to increase from 1.636
        to 2.0, demonstrating that larger material removal rates result in greater chip compression. This finding has
        practical implications for process planning, as it indicates that aggressive cutting parameters may lead to
        increased cutting forces and power consumption due to the greater degree of plastic deformation involved.</p>

    <p>The rake angle investigation confirmed the critical importance of tool geometry in determining chip formation
        behavior. Reducing the rake angle from 45° to 25° increased the chip ratio from 1.8 to 2.0 and decreased the
        shear angle from 35° to 31°. These results are consistent with metal cutting theory and highlight the trade-off
        between using large rake angles for efficient cutting versus smaller rake angles for tool strength and
        durability.</p>

    <p>The workpiece material study demonstrated that material properties fundamentally determine chip morphology.
        Ductile aluminum produced continuous chips that flow smoothly over the rake face, brass with moderate ductility
        produced segmented chips with periodic shear localization, and brittle cast iron produced discontinuous chips
        due to fracture at graphite inclusions. Understanding these material-dependent behaviors is essential for
        selecting appropriate cutting conditions and chip management strategies.</p>

    <p>Overall, this laboratory exercise successfully demonstrated the complex interrelationships between machining
        parameters and chip formation phenomena. The experimental results validate theoretical predictions regarding the
        effects of process variables on chip ratios and shear angles, providing a solid foundation for understanding and
        optimizing metal cutting operations in industrial practice.</p>
