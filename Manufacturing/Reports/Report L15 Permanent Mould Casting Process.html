    <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>

    <p>Permanent mould casting is a metal casting process that uses reusable moulds made from materials such as cast
        iron, steel, or other metals. Unlike sand casting where the mould is destroyed after each casting, permanent
        moulds can be used for thousands of casting cycles, making the process economical for medium to high volume
        production. The process is particularly suitable for non-ferrous metals such as aluminum, magnesium, and zinc
        alloys.</p>

    <p>The permanent mould casting process offers several advantages over sand casting. Due to the higher thermal
        conductivity of metal moulds compared to sand, the cooling rate is significantly faster. According to Tamman's
        law, faster cooling results in finer grain structure and consequently higher mechanical properties. The faster
        solidification also produces better surface finish and dimensional accuracy compared to sand casting.</p>

    <p>The use of ceramic filters in permanent mould casting helps to remove oxide inclusions and other impurities from
        the molten metal as it enters the mould cavity. This filtration improves the quality and mechanical properties
        of the final casting by reducing the number of defects that can act as stress concentrators.</p>

    <h1>EXPERIMENTAL</h1>

    <h2>Task 1: Essence of Permanent Mould Casting Process</h2>

    <p>Permanent mould casting, also known as gravity die casting, involves pouring molten metal into a reusable metal
        mould under the force of gravity. The mould, typically made from cast steel or cast iron, is preheated before
        casting to prevent thermal shock and ensure proper metal flow. The mould cavity is coated with a refractory wash
        to prevent the casting from sticking and to control the cooling rate.</p>

    <p>The process begins with preheating the mould to the required temperature, typically around 200°C for aluminum
        alloys. The molten metal, in this case AlSi9 aluminum-silicon alloy, is poured into the mould through a gating
        system. The metal solidifies rapidly due to the high thermal conductivity of the metal mould. Once
        solidification is complete, the mould is opened and the casting is ejected. The mould is then prepared for the
        next casting cycle.</p>

    <p>The AlSi9 alloy used in this laboratory is a hypoeutectic aluminum-silicon alloy containing approximately 9%
        silicon. The eutectic temperature for the Al-Si system is 577°C, which influences the solidification behavior
        and final microstructure of the casting. The fine microstructure achieved in permanent mould casting results in
        improved mechanical properties compared to sand casting.</p>

    <h2>Task 2: Evaluation of Casting Quality</h2>

    <p>The quality of castings produced in permanent moulds was evaluated by examining several characteristics. Surface
        roughness of permanent mould castings is generally superior to sand castings due to the smooth surface of the
        metal mould and the use of mould coatings. The castings exhibited good surface finish with minimal roughness.
    </p>

    <p>Flash formation occurs at the parting line of the mould where molten metal can seep between mould halves. The
        permanent mould castings showed minimal flash, indicating good mould alignment and clamping. Any flash present
        can be easily removed during finishing operations.</p>

    <p>Shrinkage defects were examined in the shrink bobs (risers) of the castings. As metal solidifies and cools, it
        contracts, potentially creating shrinkage porosity if not properly fed with additional molten metal. The risers
        showed evidence of shrinkage cavities, which is expected as they are designed to solidify last and absorb the
        shrinkage from the main casting.</p>

    <h2>Task 3: Main Parameters of Gravity Die Casting</h2>

    <p>The main temperature parameters of the permanent mould casting process were recorded during the experiment:</p>

            <td>t<sub>c2</sub></td>

            <td>t<sub>m2</sub></td>
            <td>254.2 °C</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>The average casting temperature in the casting cycle can be calculated as:</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">t<sub>c av</sub> = (t<sub>c1</sub> + t<sub>c2</sub>) / 2 = (726 + 293.8) / 2 = 509.9
        °C</p>

    <p>The average permanent mould temperature in the casting cycle:</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">t<sub>m av</sub> = (t<sub>m1</sub> + t<sub>m2</sub>) / 2 = (200.4 + 254.2) / 2 =
        227.3 °C</p>

    <p>The temperature difference (overcooling) between the pouring temperature and the shakeout temperature represents
        the heat extracted from the casting during solidification and cooling:</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">Δt = t<sub>c1</sub> - t<sub>c2</sub> = 726 - 293.8 = 432.2 °C</p>

    <h2>Task 4: Determination of Tensile Strength</h2>

    <p>Tensile tests were performed on specimens produced by three different casting methods: permanent mould casting
        with ceramic filter, permanent mould casting without filter, and sand mould casting. The specimen diameter was
        measured using a caliper with 0.05 mm accuracy.</p>

            <td>14.1</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td style="text-align: left;">Specimen cross-section F, mm²</td>
            <td>93.31</td>
            <td>89.92</td>
            <td>156.15</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td style="text-align: left;">Tensile strength R<sub>m</sub>, MPa</td>
            <td>171.4</td>
            <td>182.4</td>
            <td>144.7</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>The cross-sectional area was calculated using the formula: F = π × d² / 4</p>
    <p>The tensile strength was calculated using: R<sub>m</sub> = P / F [MPa], where P is in N and F is in mm².</p>

    <p>The results clearly demonstrate that permanent mould castings exhibit higher tensile strength than sand mould
        castings. The permanent mould specimen without filter showed the highest tensile strength of 182.4 MPa, followed
        by the specimen with filter at 171.4 MPa, while the sand mould casting achieved only 144.7 MPa.</p>

    <p>The difference in strength between the casting methods can be attributed to the microstructure resulting from
        different cooling rates. In sand mould casting, the cooling rate is slower due to the lower thermal conductivity
        of sand. This results in larger grain sizes and coarser microstructure. According to the Hall-Petch
        relationship, materials with larger grain sizes have lower strength.</p>

    <p>In permanent mould casting, the higher thermal conductivity of the metal mould leads to faster cooling and finer
        microstructure. The finer grains provide more grain boundaries that impede dislocation movement, resulting in
        higher strength. This confirms Tamman's law, which states that faster cooling produces finer microstructure and
        improved mechanical properties.</p>

    <h1>CONCLUSIONS</h1>

    <p>This laboratory exercise on permanent mould casting demonstrated the advantages of this process over sand casting
        in terms of mechanical properties and casting quality.</p>

    <p>The permanent mould casting process was successfully executed with the AlSi9 alloy. Temperature measurements
        showed a pouring temperature of 726°C and effective heat extraction by the metal mould, with the mould
        temperature increasing from 200.4°C to 254.2°C during the casting cycle.</p>

    <p>Tensile testing confirmed that permanent mould castings have higher tensile strength than sand mould castings.
        The permanent mould specimens achieved tensile strengths of 171.4-182.4 MPa compared to 144.7 MPa for sand
        casting. This improvement is attributed to the finer microstructure resulting from faster cooling in the metal
        mould, confirming the theoretical relationship between cooling rate, grain size, and mechanical properties as
        described by Tamman's law.</p>
